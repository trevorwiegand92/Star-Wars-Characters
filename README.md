# Star-Wars-Characters

This is the finished application that allows users to search and view and/or add characters to a Star Wars database that displays data of characters from the Star Wars Universe.

The data that will be displayed for each character is the character's name, the role they play in the universe, their age, and their force points which tells the user how strong they are connected to the force.

When the application is first loaded, only Yoda, Darth Maul, and Obi Wan Kenobi will be in the database and the user can add characters and their statistics to the database if they wish.
